Data Magic for my House Weather Project
=======================================

I'm using Jupyter Notebooks to help me work out how to visualise the data I'm gathering.

This is part of the `House Weather Project <https://github.com/users/oisinmulvihill/projects/3>`_.

Environment
-----------

Jupyter notebooks setup::

    mkvirtualenv --clear -p python3 sample_datamagic
    pip install -r requirements.txt	

To run the local jupyter which will then open a browser window::

   ./go.sh

I have a few notebooks for tutorials I am having a go at. The "House Weather" 
notebook will be where I try to get to grips with the data I'm capturing and 
experiments as I learn more.
